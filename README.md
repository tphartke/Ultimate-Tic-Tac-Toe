We are creating this project for our CS222 class. This is the second iteration of the project. Some new features of this iteration include:

An AI, which operates based off a random number generator

The beginnings of an implmentation of Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe

A Scoreboard which keeps track of wins for each player during a session of the game
